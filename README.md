# SimpleQuestionGame
This is a simple game written in Python to practice the basics of the language.

What I learned: 

- How to print to the screen
- Boolean operator (and, or, not)
- Comparing two values with comparison operators
- While loops
- For loops
- The use of If, elif, and else statements
- Break and Continue
- Range in a for loop
- Import keyword

What is Needed to Run This?

- Download the file
- Open the file using IDLE
- Run and play

How to Play:

- The user will be prompted to type "roll" exactly as shown
- If the user doesn't type the correct prompt, the program will loop the request until the user types roll
- A random number will be rolled and its value will determine the question that is chosen
- The program will print the question
- If the user is incorrect, the program will restart

-If the user guesses the correct answer, the program will announce they've won
-The program will then restart so the user can play again
